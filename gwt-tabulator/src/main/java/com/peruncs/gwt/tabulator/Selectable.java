public class Selectable {
//todo
//    String or Boolean or Integer :
//    The selectable option can take one of a several values:
//
//    false - selectable rows are disabled
//    true - selectable rows are enabled, and you can select as many as you want
//    integer - any integer value, this sets the maximum number of rows that can be selected (when the maximum number of selected rows is exeded, the first selected row will be deselected to allow the next row to be selected).
//    "highlight" (default) - rows have the same hover stylings as selectable rows but do not change state when clicked. This is great for when you want to show that a row is clickable but don't want it to be selectable.
